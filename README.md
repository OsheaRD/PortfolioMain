As a content enthusiast I have spent thousands of hours browsing the internet for great UI’s, designs and thoughtful UX experiences.

I regularly inspect the source code of interesting pages in order to satisfy my general curiosity and stay current with new styles and techniques.

In doing so I uncovered a slightly disturbing trend. The portfolio sites for the vast majority of web and app developers are built on TEMPLATES. Templates or CMS (content management system) pages such as WordPress and Wix are a popular option for consumers to quickly and simply create web pages. The framework of the page is written by a developer and the consumer can simply go in to drag and drop content to create their page and customize the major elements such as background color and font without actual working knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS or the like.

Coding is a joy for me and I wanted my portfolio page to be a showcase of well written code and aesthetic design. OsheaDeans.com is 100% legacy code and for the real devs out there I’ve included a few gems in the source code that you can easily copy and paste into your next project such as: GSAP landing page animations, root based css classes, simple and clean lightbox libraries, smooth scrolling to predetermined page set points from links in the navigation bar and stories in jQuery modals.

The majority of fonts are imported from Google Font library and the color scheme hails from inspiration I found across several color palettes. All links and headlines that are active feature CSS hover effects and complementary color schemes. All of the image classes are coded to accept and resize any source file they are given and also I wrote all the breakpoint classes in CSS to allow for a responsive design.

To keep with the theme I wrote a separate navigation bar that automatically appears based on breakpoints and has links controlled by just a bit of javaScript.

The total code is rough 6,000 lines and is available on my gitHub: www.github.com/osheard. I broke it into several branches to allow anyone interested to see the progression and steps I took in moving toward a final project. Thanks for looking.
